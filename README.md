Face Detection Project 🎯
A Python-based face detection application using OpenCV that can detect faces in images and provide real-time face detection through webcam.

Features ✨
Image Face Detection: Upload any image and detect faces with bounding boxes
Real-time Detection: Use your webcam for live face detection
Eye Detection: Also detects eyes within detected faces
Screenshot Capture: Save screenshots during real-time detection
Multiple Output Formats: Save processed images with timestamps
Requirements 📋
Python 3.7 or higher
OpenCV (cv2)
NumPy
A working webcam (for real-time detection)
Installation 🚀
Clone the repository
bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/face-detection-project.git
cd face-detection-project
Create a virtual environment (recommended)
bash
python -m venv face_detection_env

# On Windows
face_detection_env\Scripts\activate

# On macOS/Linux
source face_detection_env/bin/activate
Install required packages
bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage 💻
Run the application
bash
python main.py
Choose from the menu
Option 1: Detect faces in an image file
Enter the path to your image
View the result with detected faces highlighted
Option 2: Real-time face detection
Your webcam will start
Press 'q' to quit
Press 's' to save a screenshot

How It Works 🔍
The project uses OpenCV's Haar Cascade classifiers for face detection:

Haar Cascades: Pre-trained classifiers that detect objects (faces/eyes)
Image Processing: Converts images to grayscale for better detection
Detection Algorithm: Scans the image at multiple scales
Bounding Boxes: Draws rectangles around detected faces
Real-time Processing: Processes video frames continuously
Key Functions 🛠️
detect_faces_in_image(): Process static images
detect_faces_webcam(): Real-time webcam detection
Automatic creation of output directories
Timestamp-based file naming
Error handling for various scenarios
Sample Output 📸
The application will:

Draw blue rectangles around detected faces
Draw green rectangles around detected eyes
Display the number of faces found
Save processed images with timestamps
Troubleshooting 🔧
Webcam not working?

Ensure your camera is not being used by another application
Check camera permissions in your system settings
No faces detected?

Ensure good lighting conditions
Make sure faces are clearly visible and front-facing
Try with different images
Installation issues?

Make sure you have Python 3.7+
Try upgrading pip: pip install --upgrade pip
On some systems, you might need: pip install opencv-python-headless

Copy all the code from the artifacts above into respective files
Open VS Code terminal (Ctrl+`)
Create virtual environment:
bashpython -m venv face_detection_env
face_detection_env\Scripts\activate  # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt


Step 2: Test Your Project
bashpython main.py
Choose option 1 for image detection or option 2 for webcam detection!
Step 3: Upload to GitHub

Create a new repository on GitHub.com (make it public)
In VS Code terminal:
bashgit init
git remote add origin https://tejas-ux257.github.io/face-detection-python/
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Face detection project"
git push -u origin main
